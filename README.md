Facebook Login Replication done by Team 20.

fbplain.html contains the HTML only version fully coded by Shamikasmruthi.

fblogin.html along with fblogin.css contains the HTML+CSS+JS version of the page.

fblogin.html was mostly done by Shamikasmruthi.
CSS to make the page responsive, along with font changes, text box size changes and other alignment improvements to make the page similar to Facebook's original page was done by Sharath.

The JS (1 line) was written by Sharath. 

Notes:
1. The page is responsive and media controls have been used.
2. The login button prints to console if and only if both the inputs are filled.
3. Sans-serif fonts are used as Facebook prefers sans-serif. 
4. Images are attached to show output
